2. Genre Analysis
   - What are the most popular genres in different regions?
   - How do audio features vary across genres?
   - Which genres have the highest average popularity?

3. Feature Relationships
   - What's the correlation between different audio features?
   - How does song duration relate to popularity?
   - Is there a relationship between tempo and danceability?

4. Artist Analysis
   - Does artist follower count correlate with track popularity?
   - Which artists consistently produce popular tracks?
   - How do artist features vary across genres?

## Machine Learning Problems

### Classification Tasks
1. Genre Classification
   - Target: Predict song genre
   - Features: audio features (acousticness, danceability, etc.)
   - Models to try: 
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost
     - Neural Networks

2. Hit Song Prediction
   - Target: Binary classification (Hit/Not Hit) based on popularity threshold
   - Features: audio features + artist metrics
   - Models to try:
     - Logistic Regression
     - SVM
     - Gradient Boosting

### Regression Tasks
1. Popularity Score Prediction
   - Target: Predict track popularity (0-100)
   - Features: audio features + artist metrics + temporal features
   - Models to try:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - XGBoost Regressor

2. Artist Follower Growth Prediction
   - Target: Predict future follower count
   - Features: historical data + artist performance metrics
   - Models to try:
     - Time Series Models (ARIMA, Prophet)
     - Gradient Boosting Regressors

## Project Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- Genre encoding
- Artist success metrics
- Rolling averages for time-series data
```

### 4. Model Development Pipeline
```python
# Model pipeline steps
- Train-test split
- Cross-validation setup
- Model training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
```

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
